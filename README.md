Pt1. 

How to use Git:
1. Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
2. Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
3. Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
4. "Push" your changes to your main branch
5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
6. "Pull" the changes to your local machine
7. Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
8. Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
9. "Merge" your branch to the main branch

Github/Webstorm:

GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features. Webstorm is an editor that allows the user to connect to github making it easier to edit their project.

1. Create a github account
2. Install webstorm and connect it with your github account
3. Create a repo on github
4. Import the repo to webstorm through the interface
5. Add a file to the repo by creating an html file (add to git and then press the add button)
6. Commit your changes
7. Push your changes to your repo
8. Now you will be able to see your file that was made on webstorm in github and can freely edit the file whenever you need to




Pt2. Glossary

Branch: On Github under your repository a branch is an independent project. Your first project will be the default branch.

Clone: On github you can clone a repository, this will logically create a copy of that repository.

Commit: On Webstorm when working on a project connected to Github, you need to press commit to changes to save your edits in Webstorm.

Fetch: Fetch is used to bring in other people's repositories on Github in the case that you want to see their work.

GIT: GIT is the version control software used for people to collaborate on coding projects.

Github: Github is collaborative editor for software development.

Merge: Merge is a function that lets you combine branches in Github.

Merge Conflict: A merge conflict happens when during a merge there is conflicting lines of code in the branches merging and Github is unable to automatically resolve them.

Push: Push is used on webstorm to publish your edited files to your repository on Github.

Pull: Using the pull command is opposite of the push command, it allows you to move your locally edited projetcs on Github to your remote editor such as Webstorm

Remote: You can have a "remote" repository, for example on Webstorm where you can push files to Github or pull files from Github to said remote repository.

Repository: A repository on Github is a location where your relevant rojects are stored and managed. You can have a repository for each overall project you're working on.
